# React Portfolio

## Description
My portfolio project is a website built using React.js that showcases my skills, experience, and previous projects to potential employers or clients. The website features a clean and modern design, with easy navigation and intuitive user experience.

I built this portfolio project to demonstrate my ability to create responsive and professional web applications using React.js. By showcasing my previous projects and experience in an easily accessible and visually appealing manner, I hope to attract potential employers or clients and provide them with a clear understanding of my skills and expertise.

To build this project, I used a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I started by creating wireframes and designing the layout and user interface of the website using Google Slides. Then, I used React.js to build the front-end of the website, incorporating various libraries and frameworks. Finally, I deployed the website using GitHub pages, making it easily accessible to anyone who wants to view it. Overall, this project allowed me to showcase my front-end development skills and highlight my previous projects and experiences in an elegant and professional manner.
